                    My name is Ryan Colosanti. I am an aspiring game designer currently based in between Richmond, VA
                    and Williamsburg, VA. I have always had a passion for video games from the first time I played
                    Pokemon Blue on the Gameboy Color. Video games have always been a way for me to relax and escape
                    for a brief period of time. I love being a part of the many different worlds and discovering all of
                    their secrets. Now I want to give that same feeling adventure and wonder to other people of all
                    walks of life by creating the same video games that make me excited to pick up a controller and
                    turn on the console.

                    Here, you will find a multitude of projects I have completed in the past six months during a coding
                    boot camp. These projects were made with real professional work and in-demand skills in mind. I
                    have also included some side projects I have completed going through a self-paced game design
                    program.

                    Before I chose a path in development, I graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor
                    of Arts in History. What draws me to history is the storytelling aspect. I love reading and hearing
                    about all the different events that happened, from the fantastic to the mundane. Itâ€™s like hearing
                    a tale from a totally different world.

                    When not writing code, I spend my free time playing video games, reading fiction (usually fantasy),
                    or watching sports. Outside the house, I enjoy exploring museums and tasting local craft beers.
